# AA-projects

- **Assignment 1 — Exhaustive Search:** Design and compare an exhaustive search algorithm and a greedy heuristic for solving a graph problem, analyzing computational complexity through formal analysis and experiments.
- **Assignment 2 — Randomized Algorithms:** Apply randomized approaches (genetic algorithm, simulated annealing) to the same combinatorial graph problem, testing on benchmark instances.
- **Assignment 3 — Most Frequent and Less Frequent Items:** Identify frequent items in datasets using exact counters, approximate (probabilistic) counters, and a data stream algorithm, comparing their accuracy and efficiency.
